{"name":"Brap (Forked)","body":"BRAP - Binary Remoting and Authentication Protocol\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\nThis is the readme file for BRAP.\r\n\r\nThis is not the original version of BRAP hosted at http://brap.tornado.no/\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of BRAP that uses Apache HttpClient instead of \r\nHttpURLConnection.\r\n\r\nBRAP is a Java remoting protocol that uses native Java object serialization,\r\nencapsulated in HTTP.\r\n\r\nIt aims to be an alternative to Spring HttpInvoker and Spring Security\r\nespecially when you don't need or want the dependencies of Spring in your\r\nclient, for example when building a rich client application where size might\r\nbe an issue.\r\n\r\nThe authentication mechanism lets you use your own domain objects as\r\ncredentials.\r\n\r\nBRAP gives you \"pass by reference\" even though the object arguments are\r\nserialized and passed to the remote service - changes that happen on the\r\nremote side can be applied to the client side automatically.\r\n\r\nServer configuration can be expressed solely in web.xml or by subclassing the\r\nProxyServlet but there is also an optional SpringProxyServlet available for\r\nseamless Spring Integration.\r\n\r\nBRAP focuses on being easy to use, small in size, yet powerful and extensible.","tagline":"A fork of Binary Remoting and Authentication Protocol (BRAP)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
