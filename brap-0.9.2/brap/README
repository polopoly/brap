BRAP - Binary Remoting and Authentication Protocol
==================================================

This is the readme file for BRAP.

  BRAP is a Java remoting protocol that uses native Java object serialization,
  encapsulated in HTTP.

  It aims to be an alternative to Spring HttpInvoker and Spring Security
  especially when you don't need or want the dependencies of Spring in your client,
  for example when building a rich client application where size might be an issue.

  The authentication mechanism lets you use your own domain objects as credentials.

  BRAP gives you "pass by reference" even though the object arguments are serialized
  and passed to the remote service - changes that happen on the remote side can be
  applied to the client side automatically.

  Server configuration can be expressed solely in web.xml or by subclassing the
  ProxyServlet but there is also an optional SpringProxyServlet available for seamless
  Spring Integration.

  BRAP focuses on being easy to use, small in size, yet powerful and extensible.

Java/Application server requirements
------------------------------------

BRAP requires at least Java 1.5. The application server for running your web
application where you expose your service should adhere to the servlet
specification version 2.3 or newer.

What is in this package
-----------------------

The archive you just downloaded and unpacked contains the source code and the
jars of the core projects of BRAP, including examples.

For creating a client, you need to include brap-client.jar and brap-common.jar.

For creating a server, you need to include brap-server.har and brap-common.jar.

For the optional Spring support on the server, you also need to include brap-spring.jar.

For the optional modification support on the server, you also need to include brap-modification.jar.

You will find the source code here:

 - src/

Getting started
---------------

We recommend reading the short and concise documentation on our webpage:

http://brap.tornado.no/documentation.html

Take a look at our screencasts showing basic usage:

http://brap.tornado.no/screencasts.html

Also check out the brap-examples project that includes some more advanced
usage examples.

Dependencies
------------

BRAP has no external dependencies. The server needs a servlet container to
run in.

The easiest way of getting the dependencies of your BRAP based projects right
is to use Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org) with your projects and include
the BRAP dependencies you want.

Maven will then take care of including the appropriate dependencies.

If you do not want to use maven, just make sure you include the above mentioned
jars on your classpath.

Building BRAP from source
-------------------------

You can check out the source from subversion:

svn co http://brap.subversion.no/brap/trunk/brap brap

Building using maven 2:

mvn install
